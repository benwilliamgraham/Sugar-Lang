<hr>
Get an overview of how Sugar works, as well as how to use it effectively
<br><br>

<h2>Setup</h2><hr><pre><code class="language-sugar">
`To be finished later`

</code></pre><br><br>

<h2>"Hello, Sugar"</h2><hr><pre><code class="language-sugar">
`Run the Following Program to ensure that sugar is working:`
main() :=
  "Hello, Sugar" -> write

</code></pre><br><br>

<h2>Comments</h2><hr><pre><code class="language-sugar">
`This is a comment`

`Comments can extend
across multiple lines`

`Comments are ignored by the compiler even if they are valid code`

</code></pre><br><br>

<h2>Variables</h2><hr><pre><code class="language-sugar">
`Everything is made up of three things in Sugar:
  -  Variables
  -  Functions
  -  Objects

We'll start with the most basic of them, variables

Variables are a way to store many forms of data.

Sugar is what is known as a strongly-typed language
This means that a variable has a non-changing type
For example:`

a := 10 `'a' is set to an int (integer) value

Integers are any whole number`

b := "Test" `'b' is set to a string value

strings are fixed lists of characters (letters, numbers, symbols)`

c := true `'c' is set to a boolean value

boolean values are either 'true' or 'false'
This will become important later when you learn control flow`

`Variables can be changed as long as they keep thier original type`

a := 11 `changes the value of 'a' to 11`

`However variables cannot be chaged to a different type`

a := "Test 2" `Results in a compiler error`

</code></pre><br><br>

<h2>Forcing Types</h2><hr><pre><code class="language-sugar">
`You might have noticed that it doesn't say anywhere in the code what types all
of these variables have been

This is because the compiler can figure all of that out for you most of the time

However, there are cases in which you'll want to tell the compiler to treat a
variable as a certain type, for example when defining the precision of a number

Fortunately, Sugar provides you with a way to do this:`

a : int := 10 `a will be an integer`

b : float := 10 `b, despite looking like an integer, will be evaluated as a
single-precision floating-point number

floating point numbers are any real number, for example 7.06`

`However, you cannot always for a type conversion

This is the case for unrelated types`

c : int := "Hello" `Will result in a compiler error`

</code></pre><br><br>

<h2>Standard Types</h2><hr><pre><code class="language-sugar">
`Sugar inherits it's standard types from c++

Sugar uses the following:
  -  Short Integer (short)           |  16 bit whole number
  -  Integer (int)                   |  32 bit whole number
  -  Long Integer (Long)             |  64 bit whole number
  -  Character (char)                |  8 bit character
  -  Wide Character (wchar_t)        |  32 bit character
  -  Boolean (bool)                  |  1 bit 'true' or 'false'
  -  Floating Point (float)          |  32 bit decimal number
  -  Double Floating Point (double)  |  64 bit decimal number
  -  None (void)                     |

Automatically, it will assign the following:`

a := 10 `int`

b := "z" `char`

c := "abc" `char array (multiple characters)`

d := true `bool`

e := 1.23423 `double`

</code></pre><br><br>

<h2>Operators</h2><hr><pre><code class="language-sugar">
`Now on to the most ubiquitous kind of function: operators

Operators are symbols that represent changes that can be done to variables

For example, '+', '-', '*', and '/' are all operators

The value stored in a variable can be set to something else using operators
For example:`

a := 30 - 10 `The value of 'a' is equal to 20`

b := "Sugar" + "Lang" `The value of 'b' is equal to "SugarLang"`

`Operators can also be used with variable arguments`

c := a / a `The value of 'c' is equal to 'a' (20) / 'a' (20), which equals 1`

`And can be a mix of variables and constants`

d := a ^ 2 `The value of 'd' is equal to 'a' (20) squared, which equals 400`

`Although they can be used to modify statement values, operators do not effect
the variables they modify`

d := a + c `The '+' operator does not effect the value stored in 'a' and 'b'`

`There are two kinds of operators: unary and binary

Unary come before the variable they modify`

a := -c `'a' is equal to - 'c' (1), which equals -1`

`Binary come in between the two variables it modifies`

c := c + d `'c' is equal to 'c' (1) + 'd' (400), which equals 401`

`Sugar does not follow the standard order of operations
Instead it does everything in the following order:
  -  Unary Operators
  -  Binary Operators
  -  Assignment

Also, Sugar comes with several standard operators:`
&a `reference`
*a `dereference`
-a `negate`
+a `value of`
~a `bitwise complement`

a ^ b `explonent`
a ;/ b `root`

a * b `multiplication`
a / b `division`
a // b `integer division`
a % b `modulus`

a + b `addition`
a - b `subtraction`

a << b `left bitwise shift`
a >> b `right bitwise shift`

a < b `less than`
a > b `greater than`
a <= b `less than or equal to`
a >= b `greater than or equal to`
a = b `equals`
a != b `not equal to`
a <=> b `comparitor`

a & b `bitwise and`
a | b `bitwise or`
a >< b `bitwise xor`
`

<h2>Functions</h2><hr><pre><code class="language-sugar">
`Standard functions are similar to operators:`

a := f(20) `'a' is equal to the value of f(20)`

`Functions can be used in conjunction with variables`

b := g(a)

`And with operators`

c := h(a + 10) + b

`Sugar comes with the following build-in functions:`

write(a) `writes the value of 'a' to the console`
read() `reads input from the console`
