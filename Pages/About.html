<!--Explanation-->

Sugar is a simple programming language that compiles into C++.
It takes the incredible speed and control of a system programming language and puts it into the body of a scripting language,
exposing the power of C++ without the requirement of learning all of the nuances.
<br><br>
The goal is to be able to prototype robust code quickly and safely,
and require little effort to take it to production, vastly shortening the development process
and providing a much nicer coding experience.
<br><br>
The name Sugar was inspired by the term 'syntactic sugar', meaning the use of syntax which makes a language sweeter for humans
by making things easier to read or express.
Sugar aims to be a language entirely consisting of syntactic sugar for C++, where everything is expressible with high efficiency
while following extremely consistent rules, making Sugar easy to read, write, and learn
