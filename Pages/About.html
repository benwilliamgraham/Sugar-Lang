<!--Explanation-->

Sugar is a simple language that compiles into C++.
It takes the increadible speed and control of C/C++ and puts it into the body of a scripting language.
<br><br>
The goal is to be able to prototype robust code quickly and safely,
and then requiring little effort to take it to production, vastly shortening the development process
and providing a much nicer experience.
