`Now on to the most ubiquitous kind of function: operators

Operators are symbols that represent changes that can be done to variables

For example, '+', '-', '*', and '/' are all operators

The value stored in a variable can be set to something else using operators
For example:`

a := 30 - 10 `The value of 'a' is equal to 20`

b := "Sugar" + "Lang" `The value of 'b' is equal to "SugarLang"`

`Operators can also be used with variable arguments`

c := a / a `The value of 'c' is equal to 'a' (20) / 'a' (20), or 1`

`And can be a mix of variables and constants`

d := a ^ 2 `The value of 'd' is equal to 'a' (20) squared, or 400`
